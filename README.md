# Small-Projects
This repo contains small projects and utilities that I made in my free time. 

## Dining Dollars
This utility is run from the command line. I created it because I find it useful to have an easy way of keeping track of my Dining Dollars usage. The program takes in your current Dining Dollars balance and calculates whether you're ahead of or behind your spending target. The next step for this program is to host it online on my website.
